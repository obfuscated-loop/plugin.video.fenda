# Fenda
Fenda is a WIP (work-in-progress) fork of the Fen addon for Kodi, this was created after [Tikipeter announced that Fen will no longer receive development updates](https://github.com/Tikipeter/repository.tikipeter/issues/331).

## About
So far, there are no new features and I have only rebranded and formatted the existing code. I will be applying updates to the codebase as I see fit.

**I also haven't set up a repo yet, though I plan on doing so very soon.**

## Contributing
I will be accepting PRs and will strongly consider suggestions if they are to come my way, so feel free to open Issues/PRs (no stupid ones please).
